# Weather Forecasting Web Application

This is a browser-based weather forecasting system designed to provide users with real-time weather updates through a simple, responsive, and accessible interface. The application allows users to search for any global city and receive accurate, up-to-date weather data retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Project Overview

The system enables the following features:

- City-based weather search functionality
- Real-time weather data display, including:
  - Temperature
  - Weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy)
  - Humidity levels
- A clean and responsive user interface built for clarity and performance

This project serves as a practical implementation of API integration and dynamic front-end development, offering a foundational example of how external data can be utilised in real-time web applications.


## Technology Stack

The application is built using:

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactivity and API consumption
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data integration
